Uber is pleased to announce the open source release of Jaeger, a distributed tracing system, used to monitor, profile, and troubleshoot microservices.

Jaeger is written in Go, with OpenTracing compatible client libraries in [Go](https://github.com/uber/jaeger-client-go), [Java](https://github.com/uber/jaeger-client-java), [Node](https://github.com/uber/jaeger-client-node), and [Python](https://github.com/uber/jaeger-client-python). It allows service owners to instrument their services to get insights into what their architecture is doing. 

Jaeger is available now on [Github](https://github.com/uber/jaeger) as a public beta. Try it out by running the complete backend using the [Docker image](http://jaeger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/#all-in-one-docker-image) along with a sample application, [HotROD](http://jaeger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/#sample-application), to generate interesting traces.

We hope that other organizations find Jaeger to be a useful tool, and we welcome contributions.

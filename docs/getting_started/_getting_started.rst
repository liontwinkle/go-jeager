Getting Started with Jaeger
===========================

We're working hard on making all backend components of Jaeger open source.
Please watch the GitHub repository https://github.com/uber/jaeger for updates.

Jaeger client libraries are already open source and for now can be used with Zipkin backend.
You can see a HOW-TO example in the blog post `Tracing HTTP request latency in Go with OpenTracing
<https://medium.com/@YuriShkuro/tracing-http-request-latency-in-go-with-opentracing-7cc1282a100a>`_.
